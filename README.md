# Financial-Planner-Mod-5
Note:  Program file is in Folder named Starter_code

This program simulates alternate projections of an investment portfolio with varying strategies over 5, 10 and 30 years.

Utilising Monte Carlo simulations and Matplot graphs it demonstrates probable outcomes of a simple portfolio using current financial data from two API's.

## Insights
Based on the given inputs of current portfolio holdings and monthly income, the subjects have an adequate savings balance on hand.

With a standard 60/40 investment of $20,000 there is a 95% liklihood the share portfolio will be in the range of $40,000 to $500,000 after 30 years.

Increasing the invested amount for that scenario to $30,000, produces an outcome in the range of approximately $60,000 to $750,000.

### Shorter - terms
By contrast reducing the timeframe to 5 years reduces the maximum possible outcome dramatically. Even with triple the volume invested the highest likely return without greater risk is $130,000.

Increasing the risk is not recomended over this timeframe. Besides the greater chance of a loss to capital, the potential rewards are 3X initial investment and not substantial enough to be worth the risk

The 10 Year outlook is more promising than the 5 year scenario.

A standard 60/40 investment strategy is low risk and could return as high as $250,000 (4x) with a much larger initial investment

A higher risk 80/20 still seems a feasible option over the longer period of 10 years and the returns are somewhat more substantial at 6x on the high side as a likely potential outcome. It would be worth considering for the less risk averse.
